# Habit Tracker - Better Yourself

This project is a simple habit tracker built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to track their habits throughout the week. Users can add new habits, tick off their progress for each day of the week, and view their habit statistics through interactive Google charts. The website stores user data in the browser's `localStorage`, ensuring that the habits and progress are saved between sessions.

## Features

**1. Add and remove habits**: Users can input any habit they want to track and see it appear in a table
- Add a new habit to the list.
- Remove a habit from the list.
- Data (habits) stay on page/save even after page reload.

**2. Track progress**: Each day of the week can be marked as completed with a checkbox
- Check off habit under the day of the week it has been completed 
- Remove habit from weekly calendar if it is not needed to be tracked anymore

**3. Charts**: Two interactive Google charts are used to visualise progress
- Pie chart: Shows the progress of habits completed versus remaining - stil not completed.
- Bar chart: Ranks habits based on how many times they were completed - shows the amount of times each habit has been completed within the week
